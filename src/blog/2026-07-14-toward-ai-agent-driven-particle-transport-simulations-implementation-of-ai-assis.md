**Daily signal: Toward AI-Agent-Driven Particle Transport Simulations: Implementation of AI-Assisted Workflows for PHITS**

This is an automated SciencesLoop draft. I have not yet reviewed the primary
source in detail, reproduced any result, or checked the claim against a real
scientific workflow.

The signal selected today is [Toward AI-Agent-Driven Particle Transport Simulations: Implementation of AI-Assisted Workflows for PHITS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.11309) from arXiv physics.comp-ph.
The source summary available to the scanner is:

> arXiv:2607.11309v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Monte Carlo particle transport codes are powerful tools, but their use requires substantial knowledge of input preparation, execution, and result analysis. In this study, we present a code-side strategy for applying existing AI assistants and AI agents to PHITS. Two complementary sets of AI-ready resources were prepared from manuals, lecture materials, sample inputs, utility information, and developer-curated cautions: a bundled knowledge base for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based assistants and a compact agent reference for direct use by AI agents. The knowledge base was loaded into NotebookLM to provide conversational PHITS support, while the agent reference was combined with PHITS-specific policies and execution rules to enable Codex and Claude Code to edit input files, execute calculations, inspect errors, analyze results, and assist with source-code modification and compilation. Five demonstration tasks covered input modification, repeated simulations, parameter optimization, program compilation, post-processing, and result interpretation. The results showed that AI agents could handle complex PHITS workflows when appropriate resources and rules were provided. Practical lessons included precise prompts, human verification, well-documented sample files, explicit execution policies, and command-line-accessible tools. These findings support bundling AI-ready resources with particle transport codes to enable the use of general-purpose AI tools without requiring dedicated code-specific applications.

## Why I Would Look At This

The reusable pattern I would inspect first is:

> Turn a model response into a traceable workflow artifact.

That does not make the source a recommendation. It gives the next review step a
shape. For SciencesLoop, the useful question is whether the signal changes one
part of scientific work in a way that can be checked later: the evidence used,
the tool action taken, the artifact produced, or the review gate before a human
acts on it.

## Workflow Stage

My initial classification is **tool/model -> reproducibility**.

This classification may change after reading the source. The point of the draft
is to force an early workflow hypothesis before writing commentary. If the
source only describes a model or product without a testable workflow change, the
right decision is to keep it in the sidecar queue and not publish it.

## Failure Mode To Check

The workflow may look agentic while hiding state, tool errors, or handoff decisions.

This is the first place I would be cautious. Popularity, benchmark language, or
a polished demo can identify a signal worth reading, but they do not prove that
the pattern is useful for scientific work. The review should look for what was
measured, what was omitted, what can be reproduced, and what artifact a
scientist or engineer could inspect afterward.

## Practical Test

Run one narrow task with logged tool calls, expected artifacts, failure injection, and a human review gate.

The smallest useful next step is to turn the source into one checkable task. A
good test should name the input, expected artifact, success criteria, and one
failure case. If that cannot be specified, this signal is probably too vague for
a public Daily Signal.

## What To Review Before Publishing

- Open the primary source and replace this scanner summary with source-checked
  facts.
- Decide whether the post should remain a Daily Signal or become a Technical
  Note.
- Add one concrete scenario, preferably from literature review, materials
  screening, agent evaluation, or scientific MLOps.
- Keep any LinkedIn draft, rejected candidates, and claim checks in the matching
  sidecar note.
