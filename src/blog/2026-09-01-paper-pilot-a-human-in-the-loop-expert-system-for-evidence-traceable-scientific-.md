**Daily signal: Paper Pilot: A Human-in-the-Loop Expert System for Evidence-Traceable Scientific Manuscript Generation in Applied Sciences**

This is an automated SciencesLoop draft. I have not yet reviewed the primary
source in detail, reproduced any result, or checked the claim against a real
scientific workflow.

The signal selected today is [Paper Pilot: A Human-in-the-Loop Expert System for Evidence-Traceable Scientific Manuscript Generation in Applied Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.28596) from arXiv cs.AI.
The source summary available to the scanner is:

> arXiv:2608.28596v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly embedded in scientific workflows for literature analysis, drafting, and review. Existing systems advance autonomous discovery and manuscript generation, but do not resolve the governance problem that arises when ideas, methods, results, and claims propagate through AI-assisted workflows without mandatory human approval or artifact-level traceability. This paper proposes Paper Pilot, a human-in-the-loop expert system for evidence-traceable scientific manuscript generation in applied sciences. It adapts the Collaborative Agent Reasoning Engineering (CARE) methodology to manuscript development through manuscript-owner approval gates, explicit no-pass criteria, claim classification, audit logging, advisory LLM review, and evidence-locked revision control. The framework defines eight approval gates across the idea-to-claim pipeline and distinguishes literature-grounded from artifact-grounded claims, requiring reported numbers and interpretations to remain traceable to approved evidence; its system prompt is openly released for deployment in ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or institutional LLM environments. As a first empirical validation, we evaluate the citation-grounding layer with a controlled, mechanically scored benchmark (two commercial LLMs, real arXiv papers, no LLM judge): under coverage pressure ungated drafters fabricated up to 25% of their citations and never flagged an evidence gap, whereas the same models under Paper Pilot's evidence-locked rules produced zero fabricated citations and surfaced the planted gaps as explicit placeholders. Preliminary results for result grounding, revision, and adversarial robustness point the same way; full evaluation is left to future work. Paper Pilot positions LLM-assisted writing as a controlled human-AI decision-support process rather than a fully autonomous authorship pipeline.

## Why I Would Look At This

The reusable pattern I would inspect first is:

> Turn a model response into a traceable workflow artifact.

That does not make the source a recommendation. It gives the next review step a
shape. For SciencesLoop, the useful question is whether the signal changes one
part of scientific work in a way that can be checked later: the evidence used,
the tool action taken, the artifact produced, or the review gate before a human
acts on it.

## Workflow Stage

My initial classification is **tool/model -> reproducibility**.

This classification may change after reading the source. The point of the draft
is to force an early workflow hypothesis before writing commentary. If the
source only describes a model or product without a testable workflow change, the
right decision is to keep it in the sidecar queue and not publish it.

## Failure Mode To Check

The workflow may look agentic while hiding state, tool errors, or handoff decisions.

This is the first place I would be cautious. Popularity, benchmark language, or
a polished demo can identify a signal worth reading, but they do not prove that
the pattern is useful for scientific work. The review should look for what was
measured, what was omitted, what can be reproduced, and what artifact a
scientist or engineer could inspect afterward.

## Practical Test

Run one narrow task with logged tool calls, expected artifacts, failure injection, and a human review gate.

The smallest useful next step is to turn the source into one checkable task. A
good test should name the input, expected artifact, success criteria, and one
failure case. If that cannot be specified, this signal is probably too vague for
a public Daily Signal.

## What To Review Before Publishing

- Open the primary source and replace this scanner summary with source-checked
  facts.
- Decide whether the post should remain a Daily Signal or become a Technical
  Note.
- Add one concrete scenario, preferably from literature review, materials
  screening, agent evaluation, or scientific MLOps.
- Keep any LinkedIn draft, rejected candidates, and claim checks in the matching
  sidecar note.
